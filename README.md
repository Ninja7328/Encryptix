# Encryptix Data Science Internship

Welcome to the Encryptix Data Science Internship repository! This repository contains the tasks and projects completed during the internship. Each project showcases various data science and machine learning techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

- **Description**: Build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, etc.
- **Dataset**: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- **Key Techniques**: Data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, classification models.

### 4. Sales Prediction Using Python

- **Description**: Forecast the amount of a product that customers will purchase based on various factors such as advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation.
- **Dataset**: [Sales Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input)
- **Key Techniques**: Data analysis, preprocessing, regression models, forecasting.

### 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection

- **Description**: Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This involves preprocessing the transaction data, handling class imbalance issues, and training a classification algorithm.
- **Dataset**: [Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Key Techniques**: Data analysis, preprocessing, handling class imbalance, classification models, evaluation metrics.
